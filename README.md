- This repo contains the individual-based NetLogo model, the simulated data and R scripts to conduct the analyses presented in the paper:
"Landscape composition and plant-pollinator network structure interact to influence pollination success in an individual-based model"
- The main purpose of the model is to understand how the spatial arrangement of plants and plantâ€“pollinator network structure interact to influence pollination

The original version of the model is located in this Zenodo:
